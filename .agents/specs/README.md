# Specs

Spec files define requirements for features and components **before** implementation begins.

## Workflow

1. Copy the relevant template
2. Name the file `feature-name.md` or `ComponentName.md`
3. Fill it out and set status to `approved` before asking an AI to implement
4. Update status to `in-progress` when implementation starts, `done` when complete

## Templates

- `TEMPLATE-FEATURE.md` — for new pages, flows, or user-facing features
- `TEMPLATE-COMPONENT.md` — for new Atom, Molecule, or Template components

## Example

- `EXAMPLE-feature.md` — filled-out feature spec for reference

## Rules

- AI agents must read any matching spec before writing code
- Specs are the source of truth for props, behavior, and acceptance criteria
- Delete or archive specs once status is `done`
